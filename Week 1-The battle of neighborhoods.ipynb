Business Problem\n\nSome of the factors that are considered to play a significant role in the success of a restaurant are high traffic areas where consumers go for shopping and entertainment, where there are many shops and businesses and also places of touristic interest. However, there are also more factors that should be taken into account, for instance, the prices of property in each area, the population of the inhabitants as well as the presence of competitors ,that can play a decisive role in the success of a business in this field. Bearing all these in mind, the goal of this study is to suggest a location to anyone who is planning to open a Greek restaurant, that minimizes the risks of such an investment. It is known that Greek cuisine is very close both to the Italian and the Turkish cuisine. Bearing this in mind, the presence of Greek, Italian and Turkish restaurants in a specific neighborhood can, on the one hand, be an index of the preference of the inhabitants on this type of cuisine while on the other hand, it indicates that there will be heavy competition."
